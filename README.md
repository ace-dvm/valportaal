# valportaal

The Valportaal is the patient portal associated with the
[adfice\_ace clinician CDSS](https://adfice-it.github.io/adfice-ace/).
It allows the patient to view a summary of the decisions made during their
fall clinic visit, as well as find general information about falls and fall
prevention.
