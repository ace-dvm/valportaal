* enlarge button for valportaal
  * is this ctrl-shift-plus ? Then maybe do both for cross-browser:
    * document.body.style.MozTransform = 'scale(400%)'
    * document.body.style.zoom = '400%'
    * (be sure to check footer positioning if there is a footer)
* search button for valportaal
  * static content only?
  * https://www.plainlight.com/duckduckgo-search.html#custom-search ?
* testing of the static/ served javascript files
* make a "build valportaal vm" script
* replace current test patient data with new data (to match updates in CDSS)


* move patient_id from URL parameter to session_id in a cookie?
  * url-hacking/cookie-hacking shouldn't work
  * patient_id should remain an internal identifier only and should not have any external meaning
  * need a mapping of session_id to patient_id
  
* Consider adjusting advice.html to have browser detection. Currently the page does not work with IE11; should give a warning instead of having a non-functioning page. It should work with Firefox, Chromium, and Edge since these are the browsers that support DigiD.
